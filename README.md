## About the Project  
This is my personal **Data Analyst Portfolio Website**, designed to showcase my projects, technical skills, and professional experience in **data analytics, business intelligence, and automation**.  

The portfolio is built as a **fully responsive static HTML site** — with inline CSS only (no external CSS/JS files). This makes it extremely lightweight, easy to maintain, and simple to deploy on any static hosting platform (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel).
